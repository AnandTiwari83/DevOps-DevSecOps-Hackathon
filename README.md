## Introduction

In this hackathon, you will immerse yourself in the world of DevOps, exploring innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of CI/CD.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will:

- Leveraging GitHub's Potential: Manage code efficiently with repositories, utilize GitHub Codespace for a personalized cloud dev environment, and automate your pipeline using workflows and actions.
- Explore GitHub's advanced security for proactive vulnerability detection. Safeguard your codebase with robust protective measures.

## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: Continuous Integration and Deployment for .NET Apps using GitHub Actions**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub for the .NET application.
   - Initialize the repository with a basic .NET application structure or use an existing codebase.
   - Setup CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions by creating a YAML workflow file.
   - Deployment Setup:
      - Configure the workflow to deploy the .NET application using GitHub Actions and use appropriate deployment strategies such that the application is deployed over Azure.
   - Integration Testing and Feature Modification:
      - Modify an existing feature or add a new feature to the .NET application codebase which must be integrated seamlessly with the existing application functionalities.

2. **Challenge 02: Code Security Enhancements**
   - Activate code scanning for the repository.
      - Code scanning is set up in a repository (which could be a sample or personal project) to identify security vulnerabilities within the codebase. At least three of these vulnerabilities are addressed, and detailed documentation, including their impact and the steps taken to fix them, is provided along with before-and-after code snippets.
   - Enable CodeQL alerts to proactively identify and resolve security issues.
   - Enable repository security advisories to receive alerts about vulnerable dependencies.
   - Implement strategies to mitigate identified security risks in dependencies.
       
3. **Challenge 03: Dependency Management and Security**:
    - Dependency Security:
       - Analyze dependencies in a repository to identify and mitigate security risks.
    - Implement Dependabot in a repository for automated package version tracking, generating two pull requests to update outdated packages. Document the review process and decisions on merging or rejecting these pull requests.
    - Use GitHub's secret scanning capabilities to detect and secure sensitive information within a repository and identify instances where sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) was successfully detected and secured.

4. **Challenge 04: Implementing Monitoring Solutions**
   - Integrate Azure Monitor and Application Insights seamlessly within the Azure-based application infrastructure.
   - Define and configure key performance metrics for monitoring purposes.
   - Create effective alerting mechanisms based on predefined thresholds.
   - Design comprehensive dashboards for real-time visualization of application health and performance metrics.
   - Optimize the monitoring setup for actionable insights and usability.

5. **Challenge 05: Resilience Testing using Azure Chaos Studio**
   - Create an Azure Load Testing instance and execute a test using a JMeter file to simulate high-scale traffic on a web application.
   - Configuring Targets and Running Experiments in Azure Chaos Studio
