# Hackathon Mission and Use-Case 
This exciting event is centered around enhancing the e-commerce platform of Contoso Traders and also working around with a simple React Application. Our mission is to integrate advanced DevSecOps practices into Contoso Traders' existing infrastructure, leveraging the power of GitHub technologies and Azure services. This hackathon is a pivotal step in our journey towards creating a more secure, efficient, and robust e-commerce ecosystem.

As an innovative player in the e-commerce industry, Contoso Traders is committed to constantly improving its technological capabilities. We recognize the critical importance of DevSecOps in today’s fast-paced digital environment, where security and operational efficiency are paramount. The objective of this hackathon is to explore, implement, and master DevSecOps practices that can be seamlessly integrated into our existing platforms, elevating both the security posture and operational excellence of Contoso Traders.

Your mission as a participant is to learn, apply, and showcase your skills in various aspects of DevSecOps using the .NET framework, React, and various microservices. By utilizing GitHub and Azure technologies, you will face real-world challenges that Contoso Traders encounters in its daily operations. We rely on your innovative thinking and problem-solving abilities to:

### Integrate and Enhance DevSecOps Practices:

1. **Implement Efficient CI/CD Pipelines:**
    - Develop and set up robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows using GitHub Actions. Focus on automating the build, test, and deployment processes for Contoso Traders’ e-commerce platform.
Strengthen Code and Dependency Security:

2. **Strengthen Code and Dependency Security:**
    - Utilize GitHub Advanced Security features to enhance code security. Implement CodeQL for code analysis, manage dependencies, and perform secret scanning to protect sensitive data.
    
3. **Optimize Application Monitoring and Alerting:**
    - Integrate Azure Monitor and Application Insights to monitor application health. Design and configure dashboards for real-time performance metrics and set up alerting mechanisms for proactive issue resolution.
4. **Conduct Resilience Testing:**
    - Perform resilience testing using Azure Load Testing and Azure Chaos Studio. Simulate high-scale traffic and chaotic events to test and improve the resilience of the e-commerce platform.
5. **Enhancing DevSecOps Workflow with AI-Powered GitHub Actions:**
    - Implement AI-driven GitHub Actions for code review and security checks, leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 API. This enables automated feedback and vulnerability detection on pull requests, enhancing code quality and security practices.
6. **Add new application features into a React App:**
    - Integrate the 'About Us' page component into the React application using GitHub Copilot, conduct unit tests, code review, and security checks, and deploy the updated application to Azure via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
7. **Securing Azure Resources with Compliance as Code:**
    - Implement and enforce Azure security policies, integrate compliance scanning into GitHub CI/CD pipelines for Azure projects.
8. **Enhancing DevOps Security with Microsoft Defender for Cloud:**
    - Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud in GitHub workflows, remediate security findings to enhance DevOps security.

In this hackathon, you will be at the forefront of applying cutting-edge DevSecOps practices in a real-world scenario. You will have access to all the necessary tools and resources to effectively implement these use-cases and contribute to the evolution of the React Application.
