# Challenge 05: Resilience Testing using Azure Load Testing & Azure Chaos Studio

### Estimated Time: 60 minutes

## Introduction:
As a DevOps Engineer specializing in performance and resilience testing, you are tasked with enhancing the Contoso Traders application's resilience using Azure Load Testing and Azure Chaos Studio. This challenge focuses on ensuring optimal performance during heavy loads and fortifying the application against disruptions.

The Contoso Traders application is hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and your goal is to assess and improve its resilience through performance testing and controlled chaos experiments.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Setting Up Azure Load Testing:**

   - Create an Azure Load Testing instance, and create and execute a quick test to check the load of 50 users for 2 minutes.
   - Resolve the errors if the test fails and take action to improve the application's resiliency.
  
> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
> - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task. 
> - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
> - If you need any assistance, please contact us at cloudlabs-support@spektrasystems.com We are available 24/7 to help

2. **Create an experiment and target using Azure Chaos Studio:**

   -  Utilize Azure Chaos Studio to assess the resilience of the Azure Kubernetes service where the Contoso Traders' application is hosted.
   - Using Chaos Studio, target the AKS cluster resource.
   - Create an experiment and set up faults on AKS Chaos Mesh Pods Chaos for 5 minutes, and execute the experiment.
