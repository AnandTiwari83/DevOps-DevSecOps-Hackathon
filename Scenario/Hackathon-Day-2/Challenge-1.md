# Challenge 01: Continuous Integration and Deployment for Contoso Traders using GitHub Actions

### Estimated Time: 90 minutes

## Introduction:
This challenge is designed to evaluate your skills in creating a robust CI/CD pipeline leveraging GitHub Actions. It aims to assess your capability to not only establish a seamless pipeline but also to guarantee the successful deployment of the application.

You are a DevOps engineer tasked with setting up a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for an e-commerce application named Contoso Traders. The goal is to set up a GitHub repository, implement a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, deploy the application to Azure, and make rolling updates to the repository.

## Accessing GitHub

1. To access and login to GitHub, open the Edge browser from inside the environment and navigate to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**.

2. Sign in to GitHub by clicking on the **Sign in** button in the top right corner of the GitHub home page.

3. On the **Sign into GitHub tab**, you will see a login screen. Enter the following email/username, and click on **Next**.

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="GitHubUsername"></inject>

1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.

   - **Password:** <inject key="GitHubPassword"></inject>

## Accessing the Azure Portal

1. To access the Azure Portal, open the Edge browser from inside the environment and navigate to **[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)**.

1. On the **Sign in to Microsoft Azure** tab, you will see a login screen. Enter the following email/username and then click on **Next**. 
   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
        
1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.
   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
     
1. If you see the pop-up **Stay Signed in?**, click No.

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue the lab.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** pop-up window appears, click **Maybe Later** to skip the tour.

## Challenge Objectives:

>**Note:** Only use GitHub and GitHub Actions for CI/CD; no usage of Azure DevOps or any external CI/CD services.

1. **Setup a GitHub repository:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository with public access permission.

<validation step="5b252fb5-a2f0-4c4c-8b1d-af806a115039" />

   - You are provided with an e-commerce application named Contoso Traders, which needs to be deployed and hosted on Azure.
   - You can navigate to the `C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files` directory and find the complete code base of the application.
   - Using Visual Studio code, connect to the GitHub repository that you created in the earlier step and push the application code base to your GitHub repository.
  
<validation step="d239841d-b8fe-43cb-8170-54bf67f11c8c" />

1. **Deploy Infrastructure:**
   - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the setting and add github action secrets and variable as below.
     - Create GitHub secrets with the same name as mentioned below.
        - **SERVICEPRINCIPAL**: Create a secret to store service principal details. You can find the details in the Environment details tab of your environment.
        - **SQLPASSWORD**: You need to store **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>(Azure AD user password)** as a secret. 
     
     - Create GitHub variables with the same name as mentioned below.   
        - **DEPLOYMENTREGION**: Add you deployment region where you want to get the resources deployed.
        - **SUFFIX**: Create a secret to store the deployment ID which is **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.
       
       >**Hint**: You can also find the deployment ID and the Azure AD password within the environment details tab of your integrated lab guide.

   -  Run the workflow named `contoso-traders-app-deployment` using GitHub Actions.
 
 2. **Setup CI/CD Workflow:**

   - Update the previously created GitHub secret with the following value:
      - **SQLPASSWORD**: ADO.NET (SQL authentication) connection string of `productsdb` SQL database.

   - In the GitHub repository, navigate to  **.github/workflow** where you will be able to find the yaml workflow. This YAML file is partially updated, you need to update the YAML files with the right steps and complete the workflow. This workflow should deploy the application to Azure. 
  
3. **Test the application and perform rolling updates:**
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal and check the application status using Azure Endpoint.
   - Update the workflow file to initiate Action run on changes to the GitHub repository.
  
## Success criteria:
To complete this challenge successfully:

- Verify the successful deployment of the Infrastructure of the application in the Azure Portal.
- Verify the GitHub Action; all the jobs in the GitHub Action should be completed without any error.
- Verify the deployment and hosting of the Contoso Traders application in Azure.
