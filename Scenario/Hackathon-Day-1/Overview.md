# DevSecOps Hackathon Overview -1 Day Hackathon

## Introduction:
Welcome to the DevSecOps Hackathon! Through this Hand's-On experience, you'll delve into Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) for .NET Apps, harnessing the capabilities of GitHub Actions, GitHub Advanced Security, and Azure Chaos Studio. Get ready to strengthen your skills in ensuring the security, reliability, and efficiency of software development through the integration of DevOps and Security practices.

## Why do we need DevSecOps?
As the software development landscape evolves, the need for a seamless and secure development pipeline becomes crucial. DevSecOps combines development, operations, and security to address vulnerabilities early in the development process, fostering a culture of collaboration, speed, and risk mitigation. Throughout this hackathon, you'll understand the importance of integrating security into every phase of the software development lifecycle.

**Day 1: Building the Foundation**
- Learn about Azure OpenAI service and its configuration.
- Dive into the significance of AI search using Azure AI Search.
- Understand the importance of Azure AI search in the context of building private Open AI with your own data.
- Deploy a chat app architecture with Terraform, emphasizing the practical aspects of implementation.
- Experience interacting with a chat app and explore features in multilingual queries, and use of advanced settings to influence chat responses.

## Setting Expectations:

**Hands-On Practicality:**
- Expect a hands-on experience where you will actively implement CI/CD for .NET Apps using GitHub Actions, set up GitHub Advanced Security features, and conduct resilience testing with Azure Chaos Studio. This isn't just about theory; it's about applying concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

**Learning Curve:**
- Anticipate a learning curve as you navigate through the integration of various tools and technologies. Embrace challenges as opportunities to expand your skill set, and don't hesitate to seek guidance from mentors and fellow participants.

**Time Commitment:**
- Recognize that this hackathon demands a dedicated time commitment. Successfully building and securing a robust development pipeline requires attention to detail and iterative refinement. Plan accordingly to make the most out of the learning and collaboration opportunities.

**Collaborative Learning:**
- Understand that DevSecOps is inherently collaborative. You'll work to brainstorm ideas, solve problems, and share insights. Embrace the chance to learn from others and contribute your unique perspective to the collective success of the hackathon.

**Integration of DevOps and Security:**
- Emphasize the integration of DevOps and Security throughout. Recognize that this is not just about writing secure code but also about embedding security practices into the entire development lifecycle. Expect to see how security can be seamlessly woven into CI/CD pipelines and resilience testing.

## Use Case Ideation & Brainstorming:
**1: Understanding the Application Context:**
- **Description:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of the .NET application's purpose, target audience, and potential use cases to inform development and security decisions.

**2: Identifying Key Functionalities:**
- **Description:** Break down the application into its critical features, ensuring the CI/CD pipeline addresses these components comprehensively.

**3: CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**
- **Description:** Brainstorm on seamlessly integrating the CI/CD pipeline into the development process, automating testing, code analysis, and deployment.

**4: GitHub Advanced Security Configuration:**
- **Description:** Plan the configuration of GitHub Advanced Security, leveraging features like code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency analysis for enhanced security.

**5: Policy Enforcement Strategies:**
- **Description:** Discuss and plan strategies for enforcing policies within GitHub, ensuring code quality, security compliance, and best practices.

**6: Resilience Testing Scenarios:**
- **Description:** Consider scenarios for resilience testing using Azure Chaos Studio, brainstorming on potential failure scenarios and strategies to test the application's recovery capabilities.

## Key Features and Objectives: 

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment with GitHub Actions::** Set up CI/CD pipelines for .NET Apps and automate your build, test, and deployment processes.

- **GitHub Advanced Security - Repository Setup and Basic Security::** Configure your repository settings for enhanced security. Implement basic security features to scan code for vulnerabilities.

- **Advanced Security and Policy Enforcement:** Explore GitHub Advanced Security capabilities for advanced threat detection. Define and enforce security policies to ensure your code's quality and security compliance.

- **Implementing Monitoring Solutions:** Explore tools and techniques for application monitoring. Set up monitoring solutions to detect and respond to issues proactively.

- **Resilience Testing using Azure Chaos Studio:** Simulate and analyze system failures and recovery scenarios. Test your application's resilience to unexpected failures using Azure Chaos Studio.

- - **Team Collaboration:** Work together with peers to share ideas and solve real problems in a friendly environment.

## Getting Started:

1. **Understand the Concept**: Before you start working on a challange, understand the key technologies involved and their fundamentals. 
2. **Identify the Challenge**: To understand the challenge in a hackathon, grasp the theme or problem statement thoroughly and familiarize yourself with the required technology, in this case, Active Gen AI.
3. **Collaborate with Team members**: You might not be coding the solution yourself, but your input and collaboration are essential. Your role could involve defining the problem, suggesting features, and testing the usability of the final product.
4. **Use and Test the Solution**: Once a solution is ready, you'll have a chance to use and test it. You can provide feedback on its functionality, interface, and overall user experience.
5. **Present the Solution**: You can present the solution at the end of the Hackathon. This could involve explaining the problem, demonstrating how the solution works.
