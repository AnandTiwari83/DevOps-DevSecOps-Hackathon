# Challenge 03: Dependency Management and Security

## Introduction:
This challenge equips participants with essential skills to fortify repositories through effective dependency management and sensitive information security using GitHub's Advanced Security Features. Participants will focus on mitigating risks in dependencies and securing sensitive data. This challenge is crucial as it empowers participants to apply best practices in dependency security, automate updates, and fortify repositories against potential vulnerabilities using tools like Dependabot and secret scanning.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Dependency Security:**
   - Analyze dependencies in a repository to identify and mitigate security risks.
   - Implement and document strategies to enhance the security posture related to dependencies.

2. **Dependabot Configuration:**

   -  Configure Dependabot within a repository to automatically track package versions.
   -  Generate and showcase at least two pull requests automatically for updating outdated packages.
   -  Document the review process of these pull requests and the decision-making for merging or rejecting them.
  
3. **Secret Scanning:**
   - Use GitHub's secret scanning capabilities to detect and secure sensitive information within a repository.
   - Identify instances where sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) was successfully detected and secured.
  
## Success criteria:
To complete this challenge successfully:

- Successfully identifies potential security risks associated with dependencies within the repository.
- Configured Dependabot successfully within the repository to automatically track and generate at least two pull requests for outdated packages.
- Usage of GitHub's secret scanning capabilities to successfully detect and secure sensitive information within the repository.
