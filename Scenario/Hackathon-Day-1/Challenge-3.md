# Challenge 03: GitHub Advanced Security II

## Advanced Security and Policy Enforcement

### Estimated Time: 1 Hour

### Introduction:
This challenge equips you with essential skills to fortify repositories through effective dependency management and sensitive information security using GitHub's Advanced Security Features. You will focus on mitigating risks in dependencies and securing sensitive data. This challenge is crucial as it empowers to apply best practices in dependency security, automate updates, and fortify repositories against potential vulnerabilities using tools like Dependabot and secret scanning.

## Challenge Objectives:

>**Note:** Please ensure to use the e-commerce repository that was created in the previous challenge to implement GitHub Advanced Security features.

1. **Code Scanning with CodeQL:**
   - Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled for your e-commerce repository.
   - Configure CodeQL analysis in the workflow.
   - Address any security vulnerabilities identified by CodeQL.
   - Demonstrate the integration of CodeQL scan results into your pull request workflow.

2. **GitHub Administration for Advanced Security:**

   -  Explore and configure security settings at the organization level.
   -  Implement security policies and controls specific to the healthcare application.
  
3. **Manage Sensitive Data and Policies:**
   - Store a sensitive configuration file securely using GitHub Secrets.
   - Create a comprehensive security policy document for your repository.
   - Implement a pull request template that includes a security checklist.
  
## Success criteria:
To complete this challenge successfully:

- Successful implementation of CodeQL for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
- Proper exploration and configuration of GitHub organization-level security settings.
- Effective management of sensitive data using GitHub Secrets.
