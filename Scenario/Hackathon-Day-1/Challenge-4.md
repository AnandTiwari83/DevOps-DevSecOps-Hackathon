# Challenge 04: Implementing Monitoring Solutions for Contoso Traders

### Estimated Time: 60 minutes

## Introduction:

As a Cloud Solutions Engineer, your task is to enhance the monitoring capabilities of the Contoso Traders application hosted on Azure. Monitoring is crucial for maintaining optimal application health, identifying potential issues proactively, and ensuring a seamless user experience. 

In this challenge, you will integrate Azure's monitoring tools—Azure Monitor and Application Insights—into the Azure-based application.you will integrate Azure's monitoring tools—Azure Monitor and Application Insights—into your Azure-based application. Monitor essential metrics, analyze performance data, and gain real-time insights to ensure optimal application health.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Setup Monitoring Infrastructure:**

   - Create Log Analytics workspace
   - Create and set up Application Insights for the Contoso traders application using Key vault.

2. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Design comprehensive dashboards for real-time visualization of application health and performance metrics.
      - Participants will create visually intuitive dashboards within Azure Monitor or Application Insights, displaying the collected metrics. These dashboards should offer clear insights into the application's health, failed requests, Server response time, and availability of the application.

3. **Monitor the application using App Insights:**

   - Monitor and explore the application using the dashboard which you created in the previous task.

## Success criteria:
