# Challenge 04: Implementing Monitoring Solutions

### Estimated Time: 1 Hour

## Introduction:
In this challenge you will integrate Azure's monitoring tools—Azure Monitor and Application Insights—into your Azure-based application. Monitor essential metrics, analyze performance data, and gain real-time insights to ensure optimal application health. Monitoring is vital for maintaining efficiency and resilience in cloud applications, enabling proactive issue identification and seamless user experiences.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Setup Monitoring Infrastructure:**

   - Create Log Analytics workspace
   - Create and set up Application Insights for the Contoso traders application using Key vault.

2. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Design comprehensive dashboards for real-time visualization of application health and performance metrics.
      - Participants will create visually intuitive dashboards within Azure Monitor or Application Insights, displaying the collected metrics. These dashboards should offer clear insights into the application's health, failed requests, Server respose time and availability of the application.

3. **Monitor the application using App Insights:**

   - Monitor and explore the application using the dashboard which you created in the previous task.

## Success criteria:
To complete this challenge successfully:

- Check on the Monitoring dashboards to verify the creation and set up of Azure monitoring infrastructure for Conotos traders application.
