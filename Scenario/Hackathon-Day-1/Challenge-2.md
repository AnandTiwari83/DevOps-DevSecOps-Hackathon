# Challenge 02: GitHub Advanced Security I

## Repository Setup and Basic Security

### Estimated Time: 1 Hour

### Introduction:
In this previous challenge, you did a successful hosting of the .Net application using GitHub repository and GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deliverys. In this challenge, you will focus on implementing security to your GitHub repository using GitHub Advance security features. You need to focus on completing the implemenation of below mentioned security features.

**Secret Scanning**: GitHub secret scanning is a security feature provided by GitHub to help identify and manage sensitive information, such as API keys, tokens, and other credentials, that may have been accidentally committed to a code repository.

**CodeQL**: CodeQL is the code analysis engine developed by GitHub to automate security checks. You can analyze your code using CodeQL and display the results as code scanning alerts.

**Repository security advisories**: Repository security advisories allow repository maintainers to privately discuss and fix a security vulnerability in a project. 

## Accessing GitHub

1. To access the and login to GitHub, open the edge browser from inside the environment and navigate to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**.

2. Sign in to GitHub by clicking on the **Sign in** button from the top right corner of the GitHub home page.

3. On the **Sign into GitHUb tab** you will see a login screen, enter the following email/username and then click on **Next**.

   - **Email/Username:** 

1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.

   - **Password:** 


## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Implement Secret Scanning and CodeQL:**
   - Use the same GitHub repository which you created in the last challenge.
   - Enable Secret scanning for the repository
   - set up and implement CodeQL security features to the existing GitHub repository.
   - Resolve the generated alerts if any.

2. **Implement Repository security advisories:**
   -  Set up Repository security advisories features for App.js package. Use `aiw-devops-with-github-lab-files/src/TailwindTraders.Ui.Website/src/App.js` path while configuring the affected products.

  
## Success criteria:
To complete this challenge successfully:

   - Verify the implementation of Implement Secret Scanning and CodeQL.
   - Configure the Repository security advisories feature and createtemporary private fork.


## Additional Resources:

- Refer to [About GitHub's Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/github-security-features) for reference.

## Challenge Validations: [WIP]

1. After completing the challenge, you need to visit the **Lab Validation (1)** tab and click on the **VALIDATE (2)** button under Actions to perform the validation steps. Verify that you have met the success criteria of the challenge.

1. If you are still having trouble, you can reach out to the support team via `labs-support@spektrasystems.com` for further assistance. The support team is available to help you to troubleshoot and resolve any technical issues or validation issues that may arise while the lab environment is live.


## Conclusion
Congratulations on successfully completing the GitHub Advanced Security challenge. You've taken crucial steps to ensure the security and integrity of your codebase, especially when dealing with sensitive customer data. As you continue developing the e-commerce platform, consider regularly reviewing and updating your security measures. Stay informed about new security features and best practices offered by GitHub to ensure that your repository remains resilient to emerging threats.
