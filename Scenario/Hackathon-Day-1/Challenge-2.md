# Challenge 02: GitHub Advanced Security I

## Introduction:
In this challenge, you are part of a dynamic development team embarking on the creation of an e-commerce platform and in today's software landscape, security is crucial.

Given the critical nature of handling customer data and payment information, your goal is to ensure a setup that protects the main branch from unauthorized changes and to establish a baseline of security through GitHub Advanced Security features. This scenario encompasses tasks ranging from securing the repository setup to enabling essential security measures like dependency tracking and secret scanning.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Secure Repository Setup:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for the e-commerce platform.
   - Configure repository settings to enforce branch protection, allowing only branch maintainers to push directly to the main branch.
   - Implement branch protection rules requiring code reviews before merging.

2. **Enable Basic Security Features:**
   -  Enable GitHub Advanced Security features for your repository.
   -  Set up security alerts to detect vulnerabilities in dependencies.
   -  Verify that security alerts are actively monitoring the repository for potential security risks.

3. **Dependabot Integration:**
   - Enable Dependabot for automatic checks and updates of outdated dependencies.
   - Confirm that Dependabot is configured to address security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  
4. **Secret Scanning:**
   - Integrate a sample secret (e.g., API key) into your repository.
   - Configure secret scanning to identify and report the added secret.
   - Demonstrate how secret scanning prevents the accidental exposure of sensitive information.
  
## Success criteria:
To complete this challenge successfully:

   - Proper implementation of repository settings and branch protection.
   - Successful enabling and configuration of basic security features.
   - Effective integration of Dependabot and management of security alerts.
   - Correct implementation of secret scanning and prevention of sensitive information exposure.
