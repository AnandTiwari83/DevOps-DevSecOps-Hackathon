# Challenge 02: Code Security Enhancements

## Introduction:
This challenge equips participants with practical skills in fortifying code using GitHub's Advanced Security Features. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, proactively address security issues, and establish robust security practices within repositories. In today's software landscape, security is crucial, and this challenge matters as it enables participants to leverage GitHub's tools effectively, fostering a proactive security culture through code scanning, CodeQL integration, and handling security advisories.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Activity Code Scanning:**
   - Set up code scanning in the repository that was created in the previous challenge.
   - Use the code scanner to identify security vulnerabilities within the codebase.
   - Address at least three vulnerabilities found by the code scanner.
   - Document the identified vulnerabilities, their impact, and the steps taken to fix them. Provide before-and-after code snippets.

2. **CodeQL Integration:**

   -  Integrate CodeQL into the chosen repository to proactively identify security issues.
   -  Analyze and resolve at least two high-priority security issues flagged by CodeQL.
   -  Document the process of fixing these issues, including any complexities encountered and the rationale behind chosen solutions
  
3. **Repository Security Advisories:**
   - Enable repository security advisories to receive alerts regarding vulnerable dependencies.
   - Demonstrate the reception of a security advisory alert and the steps taken to handle it.
  
## Success criteria:
To complete this challenge successfully:

- **Successful Implementation of Code Scanning**:
   - Code scanning is properly set up in the chosen repository.
   - At least three significant security vulnerabilities are identified within the codebase.

- **Effective Resolution of Code Scanner Findings**:
   - Documented fixes for the identified vulnerabilities, showcasing before-and-after code snippets or explanations.
   
- **Integration and Resolution with CodeQL**:
   - CodeQL is integrated into the repository to proactively identify security issues.
   - At least two high-priority security issues flagged by CodeQL are resolved with documented fixes.

- **Enabled Repository Security Advisories:**
   - Repository security advisories are enabled to receive alerts about vulnerable dependencies.
   - Strategies proposed to mitigate security risks in dependencies, demonstrating a proactive approach to handling vulnerabilities.
